# Digital Twin for Smart Buildings: IoT-Driven Parametric BIM Control

## Problem Solved  
- Developed a **digital twin system** that connects **IoT sensors embedded in buildings** to a **MongoDB database** via a **Node.js server**.  
- Integrated **real-time building information** with **Autodesk Revit**, allowing **parametric objects** (e.g., doors, windows) to adjust dynamically based on sensor thresholds.  
- Enabled **smart building management**, optimizing **energy efficiency** and **occupant comfort**.  

## Tech Stack  
- **IoT Communication:** Embedded sensors (temperature, humidity, motion, etc.), MQTT  
- **Backend & Data Handling:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas  
- **Building Information Modeling (BIM):** Autodesk Revit API, Dynamo  
- **Parametric Object Control:** Python (for Revit script automation)  

## Key Contributions  
- **Developed the Node.js server** to handle **real-time IoT data ingestion** into **MongoDB**.  
- **Implemented data processing scripts** in **Dynamo/Revit API**, linking **sensor readings** to BIM elements.  
- **Designed a parametric control system** that automatically **adjusts building components** based on **sensor values** (e.g., opening windows when temperature exceeds a threshold).  
- **Optimized data flow** between **IoT devices, the database, and the BIM model**, ensuring **real-time updates**.  

## Key Features  
✅ **Live connection between IoT sensors and BIM models**  
✅ **Automatic adjustments of parametric Revit objects** based on environmental conditions  
✅ **Threshold-based triggers** for smart building operations  
✅ **MongoDB data storage** for historical analysis  

## Key Results  
✅ **Successfully linked real-time IoT sensor data** with **Revit’s parametric control system**.  
✅ **Improved building automa
